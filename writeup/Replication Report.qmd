## Introduction

Emotion is an embodied experience, involving interaction between mind and body (Barrett & Lindquist, 2008; Damasio & Carvalho, 2013). While contemporary models of emotion agree on the mind-body interaction, they diverge in whether the bodily changes associated with emotions follow a universal pattern (Barrett et al., 2006; Kreibig, 2010; Volynets et al., 2020). A series of research explored universality of how people associate different emotions with bodily sensations across 15 countries (Nummenmaa et al., 2014; Volynets et al., 2020). In particular, for the replication project, I focus on the experiment 1c from Nummenmaa et al. (2014), where they conducted a comparison between two different cultural groups - Finnish-Taiwanese (N=38). This which makes the replication feasible within the short time frame than comparison cross 15 countries conducted in Volynets et al. (2020). These groups differ more substantially in both cultural and linguistic distance than the two groups in experiment 1b (Finnish-Swedish.) However, recruiting Finnish and Taiwanese participants is challenging, and our research team lacks sufficient language proficiency to interpret responses from these groups with confidence. To address this, I propose to conceptually replicate the study using two culturally distant populations that are more accessible: native English-speaking Americans and Koreans. 

Nummenmaa et al. (2014) included two independent variables - the type of emotion words (basic vs nonbasic; measured within-subject), and the culture group (Finnish vs Taiwanese; measured between-subject). For experiment 1c, I plan to focus on the second variable, the culture group differences. Specifically, I aim to replicate whether the Spearman correlation between embodied emotion representation of two participants from different cultures are larger within the basic emotion categories (matched condition; anger-Finnish vs anger-Taiwanese) than that of between-category (mismatched condition; anger-Finnish vs happiness-Taiwanese). Moreover, Whether the effect size of the difference between the two conditions will also be tested (mean spearman correlation 0.70 vs 0.40). The effect size between the two conditions and the variability measures are not reported in the study. I have emailed the authors to share the data for experiment 1c to estimate the effect size and the variability, as well as access their exact analyses scheme. 

To measure the embodied representation of emotion, Bodily Sensation Maps (BSM) will be used, where participants will color body regions where they feel increased or decreased bodily activity for each emotion word presented. Six basic (anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, and surprise) emotions, as well as a neutral state, will be presented. Our lab has already implemented and hosted a web-based version of the BSM measure, using the code provided in their repository ([link](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/eglerean/embody/-/tree/master/v1?ref_type=heads)). I will modify the code to create two versions of the experiment (one for the Korean speaking participants, and one for English speaking participants), as experiment 1c also translated their materials into the respective languages that each cultural group speaks. Everything else will be the exact same with the original experiment, including the brush size, and the exact red and blue colors for indicating activation and deactivation, and the randomization of word orders.

One anticipated challenge in running this experiment on Prolific is accurately identifying participants’ cultural backgrounds. Especially for Korean speakers recruited through prolific, it is highly likely that they are as equally proficient in English or more familiar to Western cultural context. To mitigate this, I plan to attach the language background survey at the end, in addition to the BSM task, so that we could accurately identify the target culture group. It is expected for Korean participants recruited from prolific to also have some English exposure or regular usage of English in their everyday lives. If some additional analyses beyond what's originally done in experiment 1c is feasible to do, for example, comparing the within-category variation within a culture group (correlation of anger-Korean and anger-Korean) and outside culture groups (correlation of anger-Korean and anger-English), it could be expected that the differences between within and between culture correlation will be smaller in the replication sample than that of the data from Nummenmaa et al. (2014).

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
