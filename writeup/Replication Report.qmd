## Introduction

Emotion is an embodied experience, involving interaction between mind and body (Barrett & Lindquist, 2008; Damasio & Carvalho, 2013). While contemporary models of emotion agree on the mind-body interaction, they diverge in whether the bodily changes associated with emotions follow a universal pattern (Barrett et al., 2006; Kreibig, 2010; Volynets et al., 2020). A series of research explored universality of how people associate different emotions with bodily sensations across 15 countries (Nummenmaa et al., 2014; Volynets et al., 2020). In particular, for the replication project, I focus on the experiment 1 from Nummenmaa et al. (2014), where they conducted a series of comparison between two different cultural groups - Finnish-Swedish and Finnish-Taiwanese. This which makes the replication feasible within the short time frame than comparison cross 15 countries conducted in Volynets et al. (2020). 

Among the two pairs of cultural comparison, I plan to conceptually replicate the contrast between Finnish-Taiwanese, since these groups differ more substantially in both cultural and linguistic distance than Finnish-Swedish. However, recruiting Finnish and Taiwanese participants is challenging, and our research team lacks sufficient language proficiency to interpret responses from these groups with confidence. To address this, I propose to concpetually replicate the study using two culturally distant populations that are more accessible: native English-speaking Americans and Koreans.

The original experiment included two independent variables - the type of emotion words (basic vs nonbasic; measured within-subejct), and the culture group (Finnish vs Taiwanese; measured between-subject). To measure the embodied representation of emotion, Bodily Sensation Maps (BSM) will be used, where participants will color body regions where they feel increased or decreased bodily activity for each emotion word presented. 13 emotion words will be tested: six basic (anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and seven nonbasic emotions (anxiety, love, depression, contempt, pride, shame, and envy) as well as a neutral state. Our lab has already implemented and hosted a web-based version of the BSM measure, which will be used in the study. 

One anticipated challenge in running this experiment on Prolific is accurately identifying participants’ cultural backgrounds. Especially for Korean speakers recruited through prolific, it is highly likely that they are as equally proficient in English or more familiar to Western cultural context. To mitigate this, I plan to attach the language background survey at the end, in addition to the BSM task, so that we could accurately identify the target culture group.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
